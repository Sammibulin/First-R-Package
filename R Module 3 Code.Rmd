## This is my Module 3 submission

## The purpose of this module is to familiarize myself with data frames

Name <- c("Jeb", "Donald", "Ted", "Marco", "Carly", "Hillary", "Bernie")
ABC_political_poll_results<-c(4, 62, 51, 21, 2, 14, 15)
NBC_political_poll_results<- c(12, 75, 43, 19, 1, 21, 19)
## I have now assigned my variables


## Binding my variables by column
results <- cbind(Name, ABC_political_poll_results, NBC_political_poll_results)

results

## Generating a data frame
results.df <- data.frame(Name, ABC_political_poll_results, NBC_political_poll_results)

results.df

## Generating variables to call for the means of columns 2 and 3 of the data frame
ABC_Mean <- mean(results.df[,2])

NBC_Mean <- mean(results.df[,3])

ABC_Mean

NBC_Mean
